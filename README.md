# University-WEB-Project

## WEB Project about University

## **Project's Title**

To design and implement a \WEB system in php for a UNIVERSITY that would store the following information:

• Student - faculty number, name, major, course, e-mail;

• Teacher - name, title, telephone, e-mail;

• Discipline - name, semester, teacher;

• Grade - student, grade, discipline, date.

Rules:

• Each student studies more than one discipline and has one grade for each discipline,

• Each teacher leads more than one discipline.

The system must be able to implement the following functionalities:

- Input / corrections / deletion of data for each table. (Via HTML Forms)
- Search for grades by: student, discipline,
- References for:
• Аll student data (academic transcript);

• GPA for students per course major, ranked in descending order;

• grade point average for a discipline;

• Thor 3 ranking of excellent students in the various disciplines.

• Students from a specific specialty, having success sufficient to present a Diploma Thesis (over 4.50)

The database and tables should be created using code in php, not through phpmyadmin. The rest of the functionality should be reduced to working with forms. In lookups and searches, use a JOIN clause to replace secondary keys leading to other tables with the actual information behind them. The design should be intuitive with the possibility of returning from any page to the initial or previous page.
